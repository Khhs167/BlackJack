# BlackJack
This is a simple implementation of blackjack that *should* follow the official rules.

The entire project was written so that I could:
- Experiment with decks
- Experiment with state machines
- Gamble without gambling

It was written in C#, and uses Raylib(-cs) for rendering, input, windowing and audio.
